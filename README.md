# DATA-1202
A brief description of one of the labs that I have done in DATA 1202.
# Auto Dataset Analysis

## Project Title
Auto Dataset Analysis and Insights

## One Paragraph Project Description
This project involves analyzing an automobile dataset containing various attributes such as engine specifications, fuel efficiency, body style, and price. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify key relationships, and build predictive models for vehicle price estimation and fuel efficiency.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for guidance on running the project in a live environment.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installing
Follow these steps to set up the project:
1. Clone the repository (or download the dataset and scripts manually).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your/project.git
cd project-folder
```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the analysis file.
```sh
jupyter notebook auto_analysis.ipynb
```
3. Run the notebook to explore the dataset and visualize the insights.

## Running the Tests
To verify the analysis and models, you can run tests in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Break Down into End-to-End Tests
- Validate dataset integrity (e.g., checking for missing values, duplicates, and data types).
```python
df.isnull().sum()
df.duplicated().sum()
```
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check correlations and distributions.
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
```

### Coding Style Tests
Ensure adherence to clean coding practices by following PEP 8 guidelines and using linters like `flake8`.
```sh
pip install flake8
flake8 auto_analysis.py
```

## Deployment
To deploy the project:
1. Convert the Jupyter Notebook into a script.
```sh
jupyter nbconvert --to script auto_analysis.ipynb
```
2. Run the script in a production environment.
```sh
python auto_analysis.py
```
3. If deploying as a web app, integrate with Flask or FastAPI.
